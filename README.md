# social-network

This is a project in plain Java to implement a social network of users using weighted graphs data structures and algorithms. It implements users as the nodes of the graph
and relations as the arcs, allowing to add properties to the relationships between users such as longevity or interaction time. It a methods to look for the closest path
between one user and other using the Dijkstra algorithm and a method that uses a hashmap to return a list with the ammount of relationships every user has.
